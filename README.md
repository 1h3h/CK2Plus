****************
* Installation *
****************
1) If you have an older version of the mod installed, delete those older versions first.
2) Unzip to your Crusader Kings II game folder OR the Crusader Kings II my documents folder.
3) Make sure the mod was extracted to the correct folder. Inside the 'mod' folder, there should be a CK2Plus.mod file. If there is not, and instead another 'mod' folder, you extracted the mod incorrectly.
4) Unzip any Hotfixes to your Crusader Kings II folder (same place you installed the mod in step 2).
5) Start the CK2 launcher and check 'CK2+ X.XX' in the list of mods.
6) Check any optional modules you want to use along with CK2Plus.
7) Hit play.

* Disclaimer *
**************
CK2Plus is a collaborative effort. While most of the work is done by me personally, it also includes parts of many other mods (see credits for full list). You are free to use any part of this mod in your own mods as long as you give due credit to the creator of said part.

************
* Features *
************
- 'Shattered World' scenario with the world divided into independent counts, featuring over 500 new playable characters.
- AI Mercenary system that makes the AI actually spend its money on winning wars rather than horde it as they are being wiped out.
- New faction system where vassals are members of permanent factions with multiple goals and moods, making factions into an exciting aspect of internal politics that can be both good and bad, instead of just being glorified plots.
- Rebalanced levies and laws that reduce the military capabilities of large kingdoms with weak authority (like France or the HRE).
- Reworked difficulty system: Instead of giving flat economy bonuses to the AI, higher difficulties means slower expansion, slower and costlier warfare and more dangerous plots and revolts for the player.
- Martial and Learning are no longer useless stats for rulers, as the former will affect the size of your levies and the latter determines your chance of spreading your culture and religion to your provinces.
- Reduced fertility/health and altered attributes for old characters: 80-year olds will no longer have a new child every year while leading their armies from the front, and characters that live to very old ages are suitably rare.
- New tyranny system that assigns reasonable but noticeable penalties for imprisoning, banishing and executing characters and allows for more leeway in dealing with traitors.
- Crusades can result in independent Crusader states with a special truce that makes them able to survive their first few years. A Crusade for Jerusalem will now much more closely mirror the historical First Crusade with an independent Jerusalem being created.
- Holy Wars cost piety to fight, so that the general rate of expansion in Iberia and the Middle East is slowed. Overseas Holy Wars cost a large amount of piety, and the AI will largely avoid fighting them. Crusades/Jihads are not affected.
- More lethal diseases and battles, making medieval life the violent and uncertain existance it should be.
- It is now more difficult but also more rewarding to raise your crown authority.
- Tweaked succession laws to make it possible for non-Basques to use Absolute Cognatic. Authority requirements for other succession laws have also been eased.
- Women of your dynasty can hold some council positions under Cognatic or Agnatic-Cognatic laws.
- Many more ambitions and plots.
- More provinces and sea zones.
- Many minor and major balancing tweaks for a more challenging and enjoyable experience.
- Many more Kingdoms and (Titular) Empires to create.
- More mercenaries and holy orders.
- More cultures.
- German and French localisation.

****************
* Future Plans *
****************
- Non-Christian versions of personality traits with different piety (for chaste lustful etc).
- Grand Banquet event where you can invite neighbours, friends and allies instead of just vassals.
- Rework child education events to be more restricted by your traits, and more balanced between the options instead of there always being one 'best'  option.
- Executing characters gives landed relatives of theirs the option to ask for blood money - if you refuse, they can send assassins or launch a blood feud war against you.

********************
* Optional Modules *
********************
Use any combination of the following:
- 'Vanilla Aztecs' will make the Aztecs from Sunset Invasion appear in virtually every game as in vanilla, instead of only appearing in 10% of games (CK2+ default).
- 'Gender Equality' makes women eligible for any position on the council and allows them to inherit on the same grounds as men.

Use only ONE of the following:
- 'No Assaults' disables all assault, for players who prefer a non-suicidal AI.
- 'No De Jure Drift' disables de jure drifting.
- 'No Drift & No Assaults' disables both assaults and de jure drifting.

Use only ONE of the following:
- 'Shattered World' divides the world into either independent counts or small independent states, depending on the start you choose.
- 'Divided Muslims' divides the Fatimids and Seljuks into mid-sized states, for players who would like to have more options on Muslim states to play.

* FAQ *
*******
Q: Are there supposed to only be two de jure empires?
A: Yes, Empires are mostly titular in CK2+. See Help and Tutorials for details.

Q: I can't change succession laws, there are no options at all!
A: The mod needs to start up before succession laws are available as a workaround to some issues with their prestige cost. Unpause the game and let it run a few weeks, then succession laws should show up as normal.

Q: Why are there no plots to kill people in the ambitions list?
A: To plot to kill someone, go to that character's character page and click the plot button (a circle with a hand holding a dagger below their portrait). You will not be able to do this if you have already picked an ambition.

Q: I installed the mod and checked the right files in launcher, but the mod does not load. What am I doing wrong?
A: Check the readme and follow the installation instructions closely. Pay particular attention to step 3.

Q: I am experiencing issues with lag/slow load times/graphical glitches. How can I fix this?
A: This problem means you are running out of memory. If you have more than 2gb of RAM, use the fix in this link: http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?535848-FAQ-MEIOU-TD-Important-info-2Gb-Fix-Tutorial]this (only do it for ck2.exe instead of eu3game.exe), or use this alternate method: http://www.techpowerup.com/forums/showthread.php?t=112556

Q: Is the Catholic world supposed to start at 0 tech?
A: Yes, starting tech was lowered across the board to give Pagans, Armenians, Ethiopians etc more of a fighting chance against Catholics/Muslims.

Q: Why isn't the option to fabricate claims available?
A: You need to have at least 0 prestige to fabricate claims.

Q: Why don't get I get Kingdom de jure claims?
A: You need Medium or higher CA to press Kingdom de jure claims.

Q: Why can't I declare Holy Wars?
A: You need to have at least 100 piety to declare war on neighbours, and at least 250 to declare war on distant enemies. You can bypass this requirement by getting sanction from your head of religion via the decisions menu.

Q: Why am I losing piety when I declare a Holy War?
A: Holy Wars cost piety to fight unless you get sanction for them from your head of religion. If your piety is below 0 you won't be able to declare them.

Q: How can I get rid of rebels in a province?
A: Send your marshal to suppress revolts. They will also go away on their own after five years.

Q: Can I play CK2+ multiplayer?
A: Yes, but you must ensure that all players are using the same set of optional modules. You can't have one player playing with BLC and another without, or someone playing with No Time Limit and someone else playing without, and so on.
