Original Author: Martin "Wiz" Anward

Maintained by the Dev Team



## Installation

1) If you have an older version of the mod installed, delete those older versions first.
2) Unzip to your Crusader Kings II my documents folder. (C:\Users\[user]\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Crusader Kings II\mod\)
3) Make sure the mod was extracted to the correct folder. Inside the 'mod' folder, there should be a CK2Plus.mod file. If there is not, and instead another 'mod' folder, you extracted the mod incorrectly.
4) Unzip any Hotfixes to your Crusader Kings II folder (same place you installed the mod in step 2).
5) Start the CK2 launcher and check 'CK2+ X.XX' in the list of mods.
6) Check any optional modules you want to use along with CK2Plus.
7) Hit play.

## Optional Modules
Use any combination of the following:
- 'Vanilla Hordes' will make the Aztecs and Mongols appear in every game instead of 20%-50% of games as is CK2+ default.
- 'Gender Equality' makes women eligible for any position on the council and allows them to inherit on the same grounds as men.
- 'Hardcore Mode' decreases demesne size and income, makes breaking treaties more costly and in general slows down the pace of expansion for the player.

## Use only ONE of the following (all are optional):
- 'Shattered World' divides the world into either independent counts or small independent states, depending on the start you choose.
- 'Divided Muslims' A heavily divided Middle East where many sultans are vying for supremacy of the region.

## FAQ

Q: Can I play CK2+ multiplayer?

A: Yes, but you must ensure that all players are using the same set of optional modules. You can't have one player playing with No Assaults and another without, or someone playing with Shattered World and someone else playing without, and so on.


Q: I have claims/de jure claims/other CBs on a character but declare war says I have no valid casus belli?

A: Check if either you or the character has the 'truce' modifier, which prevents war declarations on newly formed rebel counties and crusader states.


Q: Is there supposed to only be two de jure Empires?

A: Yes. There are dozens of different titular empires to form instead.


Q: Is the Catholic world supposed to start at 0 tech?

A: Yes, starting tech was lowered across the board to give Pagans, Armenians, Ethiopians etc more of a fighting chance against Catholics/Muslims.

Q: Why isn't the option to fabricate claims available?

A: You need to have at least 0 prestige to fabricate claims.

Q: Why don't get I get Kingdom de jure claims?

A: You need Medium or higher CA to press Kingdom de jure claims.


Q: Why can't I declare Holy Wars?

A: Holy Wars can only be declared every 5 years by the same character. If you have recently declared one, your character will have a modifier that blocks further Holy Wars until it expires.
