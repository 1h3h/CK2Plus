BM_MILLENIUM;A New Millenium;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_MILLENIUM_DESC;Christmas Day, 1000 AD.  A period of religious upheaval, as pagan rulers adopt Christianity while struggling to control their subjects, many of whom refuse to abandon the old ways.  Istvan I, the King of Hungary has been crowned by the Pope and adopted Catholicism, but his people still worship the Sky Father of their steppe heritage.  In Scandinavia, Christian kings must balance their new faith with the Norse paganism of the masses.  Even Kuchug, Khan of the vast Pecheneg horde, has converted to Orthodox Christianity.  Meanwhile, the Muslim caliphs of Egypt and Spain have concentrated their holdings, but the Umayyad Caliph of Cordoba is threatened by his advisor Al-Mansur, who seeks the thrown for himself and his sons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
